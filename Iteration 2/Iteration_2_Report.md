## Step 1 & 2: Establishing Iteration Goals by Selecting Drivers.
CMS primary use cases:
- UC-2: Course Information
- UC-4: Detect Fault
- UC-5: Database

## Step 3: Choose One or More Elements of the System to Refine.
(I have no clue what to write for this section)

## Step 4: Choose One or More Concepts That Satisfy the Selected Drivers.
- Domain model for the application and mapping of the functional requirements.
- Domain objects of the CMS system components.

## Step 5: Instantiate Architectural Elements, Allocate Responsibilities, and Define Interface.

  Create a domain model of the CMS. This will help determine the primary use cases needed for the architecture. Using the domain model to create domain object that will be associated with the use cases of the CMS. Having this structure will allow for an easier time of determining what component will be used for the server and client side of the system. Since the domain model and domain object are created, creating a framework of the system will be easier.

## Step 6: Sketch Views and Record Design Decisions.
